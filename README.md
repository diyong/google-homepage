# google-homepage
Project recreating the Google homepage.


This project's goal was to recreate the look of the Google homepage through HTML and CSS. I have familiarized myself with the use of developer tools in browsers to troubleshoot code and to learn how Google developed their page. I have also demonstrated basic understanding of HTMl and CSS. 

Additional goals to reach in future projects are to further solidify my understanding of HTML/CSS as well as develop good layout design utilizing CSS Grid/Flexbox.
